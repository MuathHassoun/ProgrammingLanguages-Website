            <pre>
              Hi! I'm a Computer Engineering student at An-Najah National University in Nablus, Palestine.

              I'm a passionate web developer with a strong interest in creating educational and interactive digital experiences.

              My technical skills include Java programming, web development, and JavaFX for building modern, responsive applications.

              I enjoy diving into both high-level and low-level aspects of computing—from front-end design to working with assembly languages like MIPS.

              I always aim to build clean, user-friendly interfaces with a dark-themed aesthetic, often inspired by my love for deep colors like navy blue and black.

              Outside of programming, I'm a big fan of swimming and basketball—activities that keep me active, focused, and balanced.

              I'm always eager to learn, grow, and share knowledge through my work.
