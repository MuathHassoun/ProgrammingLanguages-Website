$_SESSION['long_self_introduction'] = "Hi! I'm a Computer Engineering student at An-Najah National University in Nablus, Palestine.
I'm a passionate web developer with a strong interest in creating educational and interactive digital experiences.
My technical skills include Java programming, web development, and JavaFX for building modern, responsive applications.
I enjoy diving into both high-level and low-level aspects of computing—from front-end design to working with assembly languages like MIPS.
I always aim to build clean, user-friendly interfaces with a dark-themed aesthetic, often inspired by my love for deep colors like navy blue and black.
Outside of programming, I'm a big fan of swimming and basketball—activities that keep me active, focused, and balanced.
I'm always eager to learn, grow, and share knowledge through my work.";
