          C++ is a high-performance, compiled language used in systems programming.

          Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.

          Offers low-level memory control through pointers.

          Common in game engines, operating systems, and simulations.

          Faster than many high-level languages.

          Has a steep learning curve but powerful capabilities.

          Used in performance-critical applications.

          Includes features like templates and exception handling.

          Derived from C with added OOP features.

          C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming and gives developers low-level access to memory and system resources.

          C++ is widely used in systems programming, game engines (like Unreal Engine), embedded systems, and performance-critical applications such as operating systems and browsers. It gives fine control over hardware, but this comes at the cost of increased complexity and the need for careful memory management.

          While it’s not beginner-friendly due to its complex syntax and steep learning curve, C++ remains a staple in areas where performance and efficiency are key. Developers use libraries like STL (Standard Template Library), Boost, and Qt to build robust applications.
