          Kotlin is a concise, statically-typed language for modern development.

          Fully interoperable with Java and runs on the JVM.

          Official language for Android app development by Google.

          Null safety and reduced boilerplate make it safer than Java.

          Supports both OOP and functional styles.

          Has smart type inference and concise syntax.

          Used with Android Studio and frameworks like Ktor.

          Also used in backend, desktop, and multiplatform projects.

          Fast-growing in popularity, especially in mobile development.

          Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains and officially supported by Google for Android development since 2017. It was designed to be fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can use Kotlin and Java in the same project without issues.

          Kotlin combines the best of object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Its syntax is clean and concise, reducing boilerplate code significantly. Features like null safety, extension functions, and smart casts make it a powerful and expressive language.

          Kotlin is not limited to Android â€” it can also be used for web development (via Kotlin/JS), backend (using Ktor or Spring), and even native development (with Kotlin/Native). Itâ€™s rapidly gaining traction due to its modern features and safety compared to Java.
