          C# (pronounced 'C-Sharp') is a multi-paradigm language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET platform. It’s known for its modern syntax, strong typing, and productivity-focused features. C# is used to build Windows desktop applications, web apps (via ASP.NET), cloud services, and games with Unity.

          With features like LINQ (Language Integrated Query), async/await, and pattern matching, C# is powerful and developer-friendly. Visual Studio, Microsoft’s flagship IDE, provides excellent tooling and debugging capabilities for C# development.

          C# is particularly strong in enterprise environments and continues to evolve with every .NET release. Its tight integration with Windows and Azure makes it a go-to choice for many organizations building scalable and secure systems.
