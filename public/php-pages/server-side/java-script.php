          JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language mainly used for web development.

          Runs in the browser to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

          Also works on servers using Node.js.

          Supports functional and object-oriented programming.

          Used in popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

          Essential for front-end development and single-page apps.

          Enables asynchronous programming with promises and async/await.

          Lightweight and flexible, but can be error-prone.

          Continuously updated with modern features (ES6+).

          JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted language primarily used for frontend web development. Created in 1995, it allows developers to create interactive elements in websites like sliders, forms, modals, and animations. JavaScript runs directly in the browser and has become an essential part of the modern web.

          With the rise of powerful frameworks and environments like React, Angular, Vue.js (for frontend) and Node.js (for backend), JavaScript has become a full-stack language. This means developers can build both the user interface and the server-side logic using the same language.

          Despite its loose typing and dynamic nature, JavaScript continues to evolve with updates through ECMAScript (ES) versions. Tools like TypeScript (a typed superset of JavaScript) help add structure for larger codebases. It has massive community support, making it one of the most-used and demanded languages in the tech industry.
