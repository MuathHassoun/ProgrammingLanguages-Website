          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. It controls everything from colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to responsive designs and animations. Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language, but it's essential for frontend development.

          CSS enables developers to separate content (HTML) from design, improving maintainability and reusability. With modern features like Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, developers can build complex responsive layouts that adapt to any screen size.

          Frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and preprocessors like Sass extend CSS capabilities and help build visually stunning interfaces faster.
