          Supports OOP and procedural coding styles.

          Fast to deploy and easy to integrate with HTML.

          PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language especially suited for web development. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and is widely known for powering dynamic websites and applications. Platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla are built with PHP.

          PHP integrates seamlessly with HTML and databases like MySQL, making it easy to get started with. While it has received criticism for inconsistent design and legacy issues, recent versions (PHP 7 and 8) have improved performance, error handling, and modern programming features.

          PHP remains relevant due to its massive adoption and ease of use. It’s still one of the most widely deployed server-side languages on the web.
