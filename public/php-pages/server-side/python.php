          Python is a high-level, readable, and beginner-friendly language.

          Widely used in data science, AI, web development, and automation.

          Has extensive libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django).

          Supports multiple paradigms: procedural, OOP, and functional.

          Ideal for scripting and quick prototyping.

          Used by major companies like Google and Netflix.

          Interpreted and dynamically typed.

          Great for tasks involving math, data, and machine learning.

          Large, active community with excellent documentation.

          Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's designed to emphasize code readability, which makes it a great first language for beginners. Python uses simple syntax that's similar to English, which allows developers to write fewer lines of code compared to other languages.

          Python has a massive community and a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It’s heavily used in data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, web development (using frameworks like Django and Flask), and scripting. Thanks to tools like Jupyter Notebook and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, it has become the #1 language for AI/ML research and development.

          However, Python is not the fastest language when it comes to execution speed, as it's interpreted rather than compiled. Despite this, for most applications — especially those involving research, prototyping, and web services — its development speed and versatility make it a top choice.
