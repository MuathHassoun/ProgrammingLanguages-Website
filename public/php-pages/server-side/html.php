          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It’s not a programming language but a markup language that defines the layout and elements of a web page — like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.

          HTML is foundational for any web project and works in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to build modern websites. Elements in HTML are used to semantically structure content, which also helps with accessibility and SEO.

          While HTML alone doesn’t provide interactivity, it’s essential for building the skeleton of every webpage. It’s very beginner-friendly and often the first step into web development.
